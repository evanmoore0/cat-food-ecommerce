Fix 
- images / add images to products
- hydration bullshit
- add products to checkout page
- center product cards
- add icons for trash (shopping cart), social media
*** Double check api/route.tsx fetch funciton for products - does it need prisma.connect? (might be slowing it down)
- Update the product hook to only fetch data if it hasn't already.
